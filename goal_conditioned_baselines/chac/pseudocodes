my design

call step on env
=> env calls policy to get action
=> env calls step on alg with action and new state




current

call train on highest level

once all levels trained call learn

repeat



train:
  initialise stuff,

  then while true:
  select action

  if lowest level 
  - call to env to moce to next state and update current state
  - check goals
  else 
  - propose lower level subgoals
  - call train on lower level

  makes transitions
  return to higher level if finished training that level
